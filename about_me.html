                            <p>At the risk of dating myself... I have been a professional software developer since the early 1980s. I think I wrote my first working program in 1975 (it worked first time, and the rest is history).</p>
                            <p>I know a lot of stuff. I have probably forgotten more stuff than many other developers know. I have worked every position (in three countries and two continents) from Junior Programmer to Director of Software Development, doing everything from CAD-CAM to expert systems to Line of Business software.</p>
                            <p>When younger, some of my writings were published in important trade magazines, and some of my ideas turned into surprising advancements in textile CAD-CAM history.</p>
                            <p>But there comes a time we all know. The time when we slow down a bit. The time when we start to care for people and things more important than work and work relationships.</p>
                            <p>Hence, this simple site or blog - call it as you wish. A simple way to share thoughts and opinions with friends and acquaintances. Maybe a way to pass along some programming knowledge and techniques to younger colleagues.</p>
                            <p>Maybe just the idea to keep working - without the pressure of an actual job. Maybe just the hope of being able to help family, friends, and acquaintances by discussing tools that might greatly simplify any number of common computer tasks. </p>
                            <p>Regardless... Just, please, do not expect a coherent and consistent subject matter.</p>
                            <p>After all, this lane has no lines.</p>
