			<h3><i>About Marcus Severus</i></h3>
			
			<h6><i>In the best tradition of classic Role Playing games, here is my <b>Character Sheet</b> for Marcus Severus.</i></h6>

			<h4>Backstory</h4>
			
			<p>
				Marcus Severus served the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire" class="w3-custom-link">Empire</a> 
				for thirty-six years, from the tail end of the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Great_War" class="w3-custom-link">Great War</a>
				through countless smaller campaigns in <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell" class="w3-custom-link">Hammerfell</a>, 
				<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil" class="w3-custom-link">Cyrodiil</a>, and the border skirmishes along the 
				<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Jerall_Mountains" class="w3-custom-link">Jerall Mountains</a>. 
				He enlisted young, barely seventeen, and learned quickly that heroism is a tale officers tell recruits before sending them to die.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				He rose through the ranks, though not by ambition. Pragmatism and survival made him valuable. He learned to read a battlefield like a gambler reads a deck of cards, always watching the hands of others, never trusting luck. In time, he led men of his own, though he found little pride in command. Soldiers came and went; the dead were just names on parchment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Marcus' years on the frontier left him with more than scars. On quiet nights between battles, he taught himself the practical magics that the Legion mages never had time for: the tempering of steel, the minor wards that made armor lighter, the runes that drew power from a filled soul gem. Not enough to call himself a wizard, but enough to turn a poor blade into a good one, and to make a tidy profit on the side.
			</p>

			<p>
				When the wars ended, Marcus did not go home. Home was gone, his family line scattered, his old estate in Colovia sold to pay debts now forgotten. Sure, the Legion paid him well, but not all his coin came from honest means. In war, the spoils rarely stay on the battlefield, and Marcus was no stranger to seizing opportunity when it presented itself. He carries little guilt about that. There are no saints in armor.

			<h4>Current Life</h4>

			<p>
				With his final discharge stamped and sealed, Marcus chose Skyrim, not out of love for the cold, but for the quiet. Land was cheap in the north, and a man with coin could find solitude easily. He purchased a small homestead on the edge of the wilderness, near enough to a settlement to trade, far enough to be left alone.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now he makes his living by the skills the Legion taught him: hunting game, brewing potions from gathered herbs, and crafting enchanted gear for travelers and sellswords. His bow and dagger are his constant companions—simple tools, honest and silent. He has little patience for politics; the civil war between Nords and Imperials means nothing to him. He has fought enough wars to know how little the banners matter in the end.
			</p>

			<p>
				Adventurers sometimes seek Marcus for his skill with enchantments or, quite often, for his reputation as a man who knows how to handle himself when things turn bloody. Marcus accepts such work when it pays well or when the rewards promise something more than coin. He is not a hero, nor a villain. Marcus is just a soldier trying to live quietly, before age or fate finally catch up with him.

			<h4>Personality</h4>	
		
			<ul>
			<li>Pragmatic: He does what needs to be done, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
			<li>World-weary: Rarely surprised, never shocked. He has seen the best and worst of people.</li>
			<li>Cynically moral: He believes in right and wrong, but also knows that both can be bought.</li>
			<li>Solitary but not hostile: Prefers quiet company and conversation by the fire to the noise of taverns.</li>
			<li>Observant: He has the patience of a hunter and the awareness of an experienced soldier. He misses nothing.</li>
			</ul>
