			<h3>About Marcus Severus</h3>
			<h4>Backstory</h4>
			
			<p>
			Marcus Severus served the Empire for thirty-six years, from the tail end of the Great War through countless smaller campaigns in Hammerfell, Cyrodiil, and the border skirmishes along the Jerall Mountains. He enlisted young, barely seventeen, and learned quickly that heroism is a tale officers tell recruits before sending them to die.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			He rose through the ranks, though not by ambition. Pragmatism and survival made him valuable. He learned to read a battlefield like a gambler reads a deck of cards, always watching the hands of others, never trusting luck. In time, he led men of his own, though he found little pride in command. Soldiers came and went; the dead were just names on parchment.
			</p>

			<p>
			Marcus' years on the frontier left him with more than scars. On quiet nights between battles, he taught himself the practical magics that the Legion mages never had time for: the tempering of steel, the minor wards that made armor lighter, the runes that drew power from a filled soul gem. Not enough to call himself a wizard, but enough to turn a poor blade into a good one, and to make a tidy profit on the side.
			</p>

			<p>
			When the wars ended, Marcus did not go home. Home was gone, his family line scattered, his old estate in Colovia sold to pay debts now forgotten. Sure, the Legion paid him well, but not all his coin came from honest means. In war, the spoils rarely stay on the battlefield, and Marcus was no stranger to seizing opportunity when it presented itself. He carries little guilt about that. There are no saints in armor.
