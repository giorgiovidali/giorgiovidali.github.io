			<h3><i>About Skyrim</i></h3>
	
			<h4><i>Why Skyrim Remains the Purest Form of Role-Playing</i></p>

			<p>When people talk about great RPGs, two names inevitably surface: <b>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b> (Bethesda Game Studios, 2011) and <b>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</b> (CD Projekt Red, 2015). Both are titans of the genre — but they approach role-playing from entirely different philosophies.</p>

			<p>The Witcher 3 is a narrative triumph. You are <b>Geralt of Rivia</b>: a fully realized character with his own past, relationships, and moral code. The choices you make shape his story, but they are always within the framework of his world. The game is immersive, emotional, and beautifully written. And yet ultimately, you are stepping into someone 
			else's shoes. I truly enjoyed playing Geralt but, once I finished the game, I never found the motivation or the inclination to start a new playthrough.</p>

			<p>Skyrim, by contrast, hands you a world and simply says: go live in it. You start as no one: you are an anonymous prisoner with no voice, no destiny, and no fixed morality. Whether you become a weary Imperial veteran seeking peace, a wandering scholar chasing lost magics, a Nord rebel, or a Khajiit thief bound by their own code, <i>you write the story</i>. 
			The world does not script or your role. It <i>sometimes</i> reacts to who you choose to become. And, quite often, your choices may or may not have consequences. You are never given clear understanding of the outcome.</p>
			
			<p>Take for example, the famous quest "<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:In_My_Time_Of_Need" class="w3-custom-link">In my time of need</a>": you can side with the Redguard woman named Sadia, or with the Alik'r Warriors that are hunting her. Make your choice or take no action: in any case, you shall not discover (nor really understand) what happens next, and why. You are left with your own vague understanding of the situation and with the moral choice you made. Yes, if you spend enough time in game and look hard enough... there are hints at what <i>may have happened next</i>, but you cannot be sure. Players and fans have been discussing the possible outcomes for ages, and even certain technical explanations by the developers are not enough to extinguish the debate.
			</p>

			<p>Even more extreme is the approach to what is considered the "<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Main_Quest" class="w3-custom-link">Main Quest</a>": you can completely disregard it, you can reject the idea of being the ever popular "chosen one" (the <b>Dragonborn</b>), you can embrace any alternate path proposed by the game, you can embrace all paths proposed by the game. Or embrace precisely none, and make your own.</p>			
			
			<p>That is what makes Skyrim a true Role Playing Game. It is not about optimizing stats or min-maxing builds: that is missing the whole point. Skyrim, just as many Table Top Role Playing Games, is about inhabiting a character, <i>becoming that character</i>, following impulses, and seeing where your curiosity leads. Every skill you raise, every moral line you cross (or refuse to) becomes part of the personal mythology you build along the way.</p>			

			<p>And then there is the reason why Skyrim still thrives more than a decade later: the vibrant <b>modding community</b>. From subtle visual overhauls to total gameplay conversions fans have reshaped the game endlessly, They have turned it into everything... from a survival simulator to a full-blown new world. The mod scene hasn't just extended Skyrim's lifespan; it has transformed it into a solid platform for the imagination of fans and players.</p>

			<p>That's the magic of Skyrim. Not the dragons, not the quests. It's the moment when you realize that <i><b>you</b> make the story</i> and <i>that <b>you</b> are the story</i>. It is not a game for everybody, and yet it is good enough for millions of players.</p>
