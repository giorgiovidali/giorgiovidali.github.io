			<h3><i>10th of Evening Star, 4E 202<br />Windhelm Docks, Eastmarch</i></h3>
			
			<p>A courier found me again few days ago. Always strange how they manage it, as if the Divines themselves keep track of where I wander. This time, the letter was signed with a name I didn't expect to see: Tyra Blood-Fire.</p>

			<p>I'd heard the name before. An Imperial, once commander of a company that went rogue after the war. Some said she was a traitor; others said she saw too much, and the Legion turned its back. You know, the kind of story that gets passed around campfires until no one remembers what was true.</p>

			<p>Her letter was short. No plea, nor threats. Just a request: that I come to judge her.</p>

			<p>The Gods know that I should have tossed it into the river. But the words stuck to me. Maybe because I have asked the same thing of others before: to stand before them, sword in hand, and decide what their life was worth.</p>

			<p>The instructions were strange: go to the Windhelm docks and give alms to a beggar. Bread, coin, or wine. Didn't matter what, only that I gave freely. Seemed like a test, though of what I couldn't say. Maybe charity, maybe obedience. Stupid, I know, and yet I hired a carriage and traveled to Windhelm.</p>

			<p>The beggar only nodded after I put in his hands a small treasure, 100 gold coins. He said a prayer I didn't understand, and told me where to find Tyra: by the Shrine of Talos, southwest of the city.</p>

			<p>It was already dark, and the wind was cold, too cold. I just felt, knew that I had to reach the shrine that very night. When I climbed the small hill, there she was: Tyra. As if she were waiting for me.</p>

			<p>She looked older than how they describe her in the stories, but her eyes still burned. She wore blackened ebony plate, the color of storm clouds before rain, and carried two blades that looked eager for blood.</p>

			<p>She spoke only once.</p>

			<p>"You've come to judge me. So judge."</p>

			<p>No accusation, no plea for mercy, just calm resignation. Then she charged.</p>

			<p>The fight was brutal, and long. She moved like a soldier, disciplined, every swing measured. I parried, stepped aside, parried, took a hit, let her wear herself down. When she finally faltered, I took my chance and struck once, twice, and clean through the heart.</p>

			<p>She fell without a sound.</p>

			<p>I had to sit and catch my breath. I pulled a healing potion from my backpack, then another.</p>

			<p>After, when I could stand on my feet again, I searched her body. No gold, no letters. Just the armor, still warm, and the faint scent of mountain flowers on the leather, the kind we soldiers use to mask the smell of blood.</p>

			<p>I took the armor. Not for its worth, it's battered, ruined in places. But leaving it behind felt like leaving her nameless. Whatever she'd done, she'd been one of us once. Legion.</p>

			<p>When I returned to Windhelm, no one knew her name. There was no bounty, no cheers. The city and the world just ignored her.</p>

			<p>Maybe that's what she wanted, not forgiveness, not glory. Just to be ended by someone who would understand. Someone who, maybe, had seen the same rot from the inside.</p>

			<p>I've killed for duty, for coin, for survival. But this felt different. Like standing in front of a mirror and watching the reflection swing first.</p>

			<p>The armor sits beside the campfire now, black and shining in the light. It would fit me well, yet I shall not wear it. I'll repair it, clean it, give it back its shine. I'll store it carefully, and certainly will not display it on a mannequin in the armory.</p>

			<p>Before I go to sleep, I have a thought. Maybe the real curse is that we cannot see anymore that thin, thin line between killer and judge.</p>
