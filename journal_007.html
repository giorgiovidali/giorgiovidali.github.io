			<h3><i>7th of Evening Star, 4E 202<br />North of Falkreath</i></h3>

			<p>
			The road south from Whiterun to Falkreath was quiet for once. Cold air, thin mist, smell of pines. I sold what I could in town - potions, pelts, a few trinkets from Whiterun's markets. I was planning to rest for a week before moving on.
			</p>

			<p>
			But peace never lasts long in Skyrim. I should know that, by now.
			</p>

			<p>
			The locals in Falkreath told me tales of an ancient evil stirring in the crypts west of town. They whispered of a vampire lord named Vighar, sealed away generations ago. The guards called it the Dark Ancestor legend. Also, they said he'd broken free and begun feeding again, preying on hunters and travelers.
			</p>

			<p>
			Superstition, I thought at first. Every province has its ghost stories. But then I saw the bodies: drained, gray, stiff as frozen bark. And when a guard offered a bounty, I found myself agreeing before I even thought to ask why. The old habits never fade. You hear the word threat, and you start checking your blade.
			</p>

			<p>
			I tracked the creature to the old Bloodlet Throne fort, into the hillside and southeast of Helgen. The entrance stank of death and candle smoke. Inside, the place was crawling with thralls: men and women who still wore the faces of the living but whose eyes were long gone. One came at me with a butcher's cleaver; I put an arrow through his heart, though he didn't seem to notice.
			</p>

			<p>
			The tunnels twisted downward into stone chambers lined with coffins and runes so old that the carvings had eroded into nonsense. I found lesser vampires there: pale faces with blackened mouths. Few of them I burned with incendiary arrows. Some I dispatched with dagger. Even dead, they twitched for a moment, as if clinging to the idea of life.
			</p>

			<p>
			Then I found <i>him</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Vighar</b> was waiting by a blood altar overlooking a small arena, wearing the rags and armor of a nobleman, speaking in the voice of a priest. He called me brother in war and said he'd been a soldier too, in a time before the Empire, even before Cyrodiil had a name. He claimed his thirst was just another kind of duty, and that men like us were always slaves to one cause or another.
			</p>

			<p>
			Then he moved.
			</p>

			<p>
			Steel and fire, that's all it was in the end. His blade shattered my warding spell, but I caught him off balance and drove a silvered dagger beneath his ribs. The fire salts did the rest. Screaming, he fell to ashes, and with him whatever legend Falkreath feared. I took what was left: a ring, a few gemstones, nothing worth the trouble. His lair was littered with bones and the kind of journals best left unread.
			</p>

			<p>
			When I brought proof of the kill to the Jarl's men, the bounty barely covered a good bottle of mead. The guards thanked me with a nervous smile, like they were afraid to meet my eyes. "You've done a great service", one said. His tone told me he was just relieved it wasn't his problem anymore.
			</p>

			<p>
			I don't know what bothers me more: that I risked my life for so little, or that the vampire's words still echo in my head.
			</p>

			<p>
			<i>"You fight what you don't understand, but you are no different from us. You feed on death, same as we do."</i>
			</p>

			<p>
			Maybe he meant it as mockery. Maybe as truth. Either way, I haven't slept well since. 
			</p>

			<p>
			I used to think I understood monsters. Now I'm not so sure.
			</p>
