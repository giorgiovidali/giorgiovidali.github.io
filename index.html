		<h3><i>Introduction</i></h3>
		<p>This is the "Journal" of <a href="about_marcus.html" class="w3-custom-link">Marcus Severus</a>, my latest character 
		   in the Role Playing Game "<a href="about_skyrim" class="w3-custom-link">Skyrim</a>". A simple project that 
		   allows me to combine a handful of my hobbies: role-playing, video-games, fantasy writing, and some coding just for kicks.</p>
		<p>As of now, I am more interested in the development of the character Marcus Severus and am not very much concerned with the
		   alluring, technical aspect of assembling a website. In fact, the simple and economical markup is just a way to easily share my stories
		   with anybody who would care to read them. Therefore, do not expect much, from the aesthetic point of view. If anything, the site is 
		   (more or less) perfectly usable and readable on mobile devices. I could even go as far as to say that I have
		   (more or less) implemented a <i>responsive design</i>. Just make a note of the multiple iterations of the "more or less" modifier.
		</p>
		<p>If you are not familiar with Role-Playing games and video-games, if you do not know much (or anything at all) about the world of 
		   the Elder Scrolls and <a href="about_skyrim" class="w3-custom-link">Skyrim</a>, just take a look at the relevant section 
		   and the backstory of the character <a href="about_marcus.html" class="w3-custom-link">Marcus Severus</a>.
		   Or just jump into <a href="journals.html" class="w3-custom-link">Marcus Severus' journal entries</a>, in any order but - preferably - just one after the other.
		   I'll keep adding more journal entries as I continue to play this game... that I have been playing for the past 14 years...
		</p>

		<p>In the interest of disclosure, and before someone starts advancing strange and irrelevant claims... I do not have anything against
		   AI and LLMs. In fact, for this weird project of mine, I often use Microsoft Copilot and a small dose of ChatGPT to revise my own writing and superimpose (when necessary)
		   the appropriate tone and style to match the general tone and style found in all Skyrim books, notes, and journals. If you are interested 
		   in the topic, and to compare, you can visit the famous <a href="https://www.imperial-library.info/game-books/tes5-skyrim-books" class="w3-custom-link">Imperial Library</a>
		   - and probably get lost in it, for days.		   
		</p>

		<p>Have fun, if you can tolerate the writing.</p>
