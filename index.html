		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>This is the "Journal" of <a href="about_marcus.html">Marcus Severus</a>, my latest character 
		   in the Role Playing Game "<a href="about_skyrim">Skyrim</a>". A simple project that 
		   allows me to combine a handful of my hobbies: role-playing, video-games, fantasy writing, and some coding just for kicks.
		   As of now, I am more interested in the development of the character Marcus Severus and am not very much concerned with the
		   technical aspect of assembling a website. In fact, the simple and economical markup is just a way to easily share my stories
		   with anybody who would care to read them. Do not expect much, from the aesthetic point of view.</p>
		<p>If you are not familiar with Role-Playing games and video-games, if you do not know much (or anything at all) about the world of 
		   the Elder Scrolls and <a href="about_skyrim">Skyrim</a>, just take a look at the "<a href="about_skyrim">About Skyrim</a>" section 
		   and the backstory of the character <a href="about_marcus.html">Marcus Severus</a>.
		   Or just jump into Marcus Severus' journal entries, in any order but - preferably - just one after the other. I'll keep adding more 
		   journal entries as I continue to play the game.
		</p>
		<p>Have fun, if you can tolerate the writing.</p>
