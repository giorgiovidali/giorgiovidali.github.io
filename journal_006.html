			<h3><i>Fredas, 25th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 202<br />Whiterun & Swindler's Den</i></h3>

			<p>Back in Whiterun, at last. The noise and the crowd shake off the silence of the Reach, just a bit. I came to sell pelts, restock potions, and sleep in a bed that didn't smell of camp smoke. Instead, I walked into someone else's war.</p>

			<p>A Redguard woman, tending tables at the Bannered Mare,told me that her name is Sadia. Said she was hiding from assassins called the Alik'r, men from her homeland sent to drag her back across the desert. Claimed she'd refused some nobleman's "invitation" and earned a death sentence for it. She spoke with conviction, fear carefully tucked behind her pride. I believed her, or maybe I just wanted to.</p>

			<p>Two days later, I found the Alik'r, just beyond the city gates. Polite men, disciplined. They called her a traitor, said she sold out her own city to the Aldmeri Dominion during the war. They were asking for help to bring her back alive, to face trial. There weas no rage in their eyes, only certainty. The kind that frightens me more than madness ever did.</p>

			<p>Both stories couldn't be true, but both sounded like they might be. Those are the worst kind of lie, the kind built on just enough truth to stand upright.</p>

			<p>Tracked down the Alik'r, they had made camp in a damp cave called Swindler's Den, West of Whiterun. I asked them to leave her be. And they warned me not to interfere. I should've walked away. But there was something in Sadia's voice when she spoke of being hunted, something I though I recognized. The sound of someone who has already run too far.</p>

			<p>I wasn't surprised when the Alik'r attacked me. When blades were drawn, I didn't think, just reacted. The camp became a battlefield in moments. Steel clashing, screams of pain, and me in the center of it all again.</p>

			<p>They fought well, better than most. Too well for hired killers. I took no joy in the killing, I just did what I always do, with efficiency. One by one they fell, until the last of them bled out by the campfire. I told myself that Sadia was safe, as I wiped the blade clean. </p>

			<p>Back in Whiterun, Sadia thanked me with tears and trembling hands. She said she'd never forget what I'd done. I almost, almost believed her. Until I saw the look in her eyes when she spoke of the Alik'r. Not fear, not relief... something colder. Contempt? Maybe victory?</p>

			<p>Tonight I lie awake, echoes of the fight in the back of my mind. The sound of disciplined men dying for a cause they believed was just. And me, an aged man who picked a side without ever knowing the truth.</p>

			<p>Was Sadia innocent? Or did I just slaughter loyal men, only to protect a traitor? There's no way to know. Maybe both, maybe neither. War teaches us that justice and truth rarely share the same table. Skyrim keeps reminding me.</p>

			<p>The gold she gave me sits untouched in my pack. I should spend it, but it feels wrong. Blood money always does.</p>

			<p>Tomorrow, I'll leave Whiterun again. The city's too loud, the eyes too curious. I'll head to Falkreath for more trade, than travel east for a while. Maybe the Rift, maybe the lakes. Somewhere quiet, where a man can rest for a few days and forget that every choice he makes seems to leave another ghost behind.</p>
