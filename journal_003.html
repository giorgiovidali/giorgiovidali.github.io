			<h3><i>18th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 202<br />Rorikstead, Whiterun Hold</i></h3>

			<p>Made Rorikstead by midmorning. The weather held, and the road was kind. No wolves, no rain, just the wind and the mountains in the distance. For once, Skyrim decided not to test me.</p>

			<p>The village is smaller than I remembered. A handful of farms, a mill, and a tavern that looks ready to fall over in a strong breeze. But the folk are decent, the kind who keep their heads down and their doors mended. I prefer places like this. You can tell the measure of a town by how quiet it is.</p>

			<p>Stopped at the Frostfruit Inn first. The innkeeper, a broad-shouldered woman named Mralki, gave me that wary look all outsiders get. Can't blame her. An Imperial stranger walks in smelling of smoke and blood, and everyone's first thought is trouble. I bought a room and a hot meal to ease their nerves. Nothing warms Skyrim hearts like gold on the counter.</p>

			<p>Word travels fast out here. Before I'd even finished my stew, a farmer asked if I was "the one who cleared Greymore". I didn't bother confirming or denying, but the way he nodded told me he'd already decided the answer. Funny thing about stories: they grow faster than crops. By now, I imagine I single-handedly slew a hundred bandits and liberated a garrison of kidnapped nobles. Let them talk. It costs me nothing.</p>

			<p>Still, I don't mind the rumor. It makes the roads safer if people think I'm someone to leave alone.</p>

			<p>Spent the afternoon trading. Sold the enchanted bow "Second Chances" to the blacksmith's apprentice, a bright-eyed boy who looked like he'd never drawn blood in his life. He paid well, probably too well. I told him to treat it with respect. He said he'd use it to keep wolves off the sheep. A noble enough cause, I suppose. The irony isn't lost on me: a weapon made for war, now to guard livestock. Perhaps that's the closest thing to redemption an old weapon can get.</p>

			<p>I bought supplies: salt, fletching feathers, a small bundle of frost mirriam herbs. Spent the evening mending gear by the fire. Mralki's daughter brought me a Nord ale and asked if I'd tell her what really happened at the fort. I told her the truth: that bandits attacked me, and I defended myself. She frowned and said that didn't sound like the stories. I told her that most stories don't sound like the truth. She laughed, then went back to her chores.</p>

			<p>It's quiet now. The fire's low, and I can hear the wind slipping through the cracks in the shutters. I should sleep, but the body still hums after a fight. The old nerves don't calm as quickly as they used to.</p>

			<p>Part of me wonders why I didn't just walk away from Greymore when they fired that first arrow. I could have run. I didn't need to fight. But I did. Reflex, instinct, maybe something deeper. Maybe I still need the violence more than I'd like to admit. The Legion trained it into me, and I've worn it like a second skin ever since. You don't shed that. You just learn to live with it.</p>

			<p>Tomorrow I'll move on. Maybe ride toward Falkreath. Might be good hunting there... for game, or for purpose. I'll decide after breakfast.</p>

			<p>For tonight, I'll let the silence be enough. Skyrim doesn't give peace easily, but now and then, it allows a man to borrow a moment of it.</p>
