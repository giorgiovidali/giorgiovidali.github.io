			<h3>17th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 202 — Fort Greymore, Whiterun Hold</h3>
			            
            <p>I didn't set out looking for a fight today. The road west from Whiterun was quiet, the air sharp with frost and the sun sitting low over the tundra. I'd planned to make Rorikstead by nightfall — sell a few trinkets, rest a couple of days, then circle south toward Falkreath. A simple errand, no trouble expected.</p>

            <p>But trouble doesn't need an invitation.</p>

            <p>I passed Fort Greymore around midday, or what's left of it. I remembered it as an old Imperial garrison back when the Legion still kept order here. A decent fort once, well-built stone, good sightlines. Now it's a ruin crawling with bandits who probably don't even know who raised those walls. I might've kept walking, but one of them decided I looked like an easy mark.</p>

            <p>An arrow hissed past my shoulder. Bad aim, too eager. I dropped my pack and dove for the ditch before the second shot came. The old instincts woke up quick. Funny how that works. Thirty years of war and you tell yourself you've put it all behind you, but one arrow and your hands remember everything.</p>

            <p>They came down from the walls shouting, blades drawn. I counted four at first, maybe more inside. I warned them once, they didn't listen. So I drew the dagger. The first man fell before he reached me, a clean throw to the throat. The second took an arrow to the knee before he could even lift his shield. The rest... well, it stopped being a skirmish and started being work.</p>

            <p>By the time the sun dipped behind the walls, Fort Greymore was quiet again. I cleared the courtyard, then the keep. Sixteen bodies, give or take. Most too young to have seen real war. Desperate folk, probably, deserters, thieves, drifters who thought they could play at being soldiers. It's strange, but I almost pitied them. Almost.</p>

            <p>Inside the keep I found the remains of the old barracks — half collapsed, but familiar enough. Rusted Legion armor piled in corners, a few old standards used for kindling. I don't know why that sight hit harder than the fight itself. Maybe because it's proof of what becomes of all our banners in the end.</p>

            <p>I took what was worth taking:coin, some lockpicks, a steel bow someone had tried to enchant and botched badly. I reworked the enchantment by the firelight, enough to make it steady and sharp again. It's a good weapon now. I'll keep it, or sell it. Maybe name it Second Chances just to amuse myself.</p>

            <p>I burned the bodies, outside the walls, before I left. Better than letting the wolves have them. The smoke followed me down the road for a mile or two, clinging to my cloak like a memory that refuses to fade.</p>

            <p>Tonight I'm camped by a stream halfway to Rorikstead. My hands ache from the fight, my knee too. An old wound, reminding me it's still there. The stars are bright, and the water runs clear, and for the moment, that's enough.</p>

            <p>I didn't start the day wanting blood, but Skyrim seems determined to test my patience. Maybe this land doesn't believe in peace. Or maybe men like me just aren't meant to find it.</p>

            <p>Still, the Fort is clear now. Safer roads, at least for a while. I suppose that's something.</p>
