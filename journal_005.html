			<h3><i>22nd of Sun's Dusk, 4E 202 — Camp above Red Eagle's Redoubt</i></h3>

			<p>I went back.</p>

			<p>Couldn't sleep. The wind carried strange whispers through the night, probably just the stone shifting in the cold, but it sounded like words. I told myself it was nothing, packed up before dawn, and descended into the canyon. The mist was thick.</p>

			<p>The tomb was still open from yesterday. No sign of Forsworn this time. Maybe they fled, or something else kept them away. The air inside had changed. Warmer. Still wrong, but quieter, as if whatever lingered there had been waiting.</p>

			<p>I won't write what happened past the first chamber. Some things are better left unsaid and unrecorded, and my hands still shake when I try to remember clearly. There was movement, and sound. Not shouting, not speech, something deeper, older. It felt like standing in the heart of a storm made of memory.</p>

			<p>When it ended, I was still alive. That much I know.</p>

			<p>That sword is gone. Not taken, gone. The platform where it rested is bare, save for some ash that burns cold when touched. I left the tomb as soon as I could draw breath again. My pack was still where I'd left it, and the sky had cleared. Sunlight on the rocks felt like mercy.</p>

			<p>I've made camp above the valley now. From here I can see the smoke of distant fires, Forsworn camps, most likely. The air feels lighter tonight, though I can't tell if that's peace or exhaustion.</p>

			<p>I found one thing in my pack that wasn't there before: a small fragment of blackened steel, no bigger than a coin. I don't know how it got there. It hums faintly when I hold it, like it remembers something it refuses to say. I've wrapped it in cloth and stowed it deep. Whatever it is, I'll study it later. Or throw it into a river. Haven't decided yet.</p>

			<p>There is a saying in the Imperial Legion: "Every ghost leaves a debt." I used to think it was a metaphor. Now I'm not so sure.</p>

			<p>Tomorrow I'll head back toward Whiterun. I've had my fill of legends, for now. The Reach can keep its kings and its curses. I came here for quiet work and clean air, not to wake the dead.</p>

			<p>Still... I can't shake the feeling that something followed me out of that place. Not a presence, more like an echo. Almost like a question, waiting for an answer I don't want to give.</p>

			<p>The fire's dying low. I'll let it. The night feels watchful, but not hostile. Maybe that's enough.</p>

			<p>For now, I'll sleep. And hope the dreams stay empty.</p>
