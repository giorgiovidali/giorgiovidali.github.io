			<h3><i>21st of Sun's Dusk, 4E 202<br />Somewhere in the Reach</i></h3>

			<p>The road west is crueler than I expected. The tundra gives way to stone, and the stone rises into jagged spires that claw at the sky. The Reach is no place for the soft-hearted. Wind howls through the canyons like an old ghost, and every shadow hides teeth.</p>

			<p>Three days since I left Rorikstead, and I was heading toward Falkreath. I've camped in ruined watchtowers, under crumbling bridges, and once in a Forsworn cave I cleared out by torchlight. They fight like animals, wild and fearless, painted in blood, screaming names of long-dead kings. Among their loot I found something strange: a brittle parchment, written in an older hand. Half the words were gone, but the name stood clear enough: Red Eagle.</p>

			<p>I've heard the story before, of course. Every tavern bard in Skyrim's west sings it to anyone drunk enough to listen: a Reachman warlord who rose against the Empire, wielding a flaming sword, betrayed by his own kin, buried with his blade in a forgotten tomb. It's the kind of tale that keeps locals proud and outsiders wary.</p>

			<p>Normally I'd dismiss it. Legends are for poets and fools. But the map scratched onto that parchment marks a real place, a cleft in the mountains south of Sundered Towers, where the stone turns red with iron. Curiosity got the better of me, and I forgot about Falkreath. I've followed worse leads for less reward.</p>

			<p>Today I reached the outskirts of what must once have been a fortress, half-swallowed by the mountain, bones of ancient walls jutting from the earth like broken ribs. Forsworn tracks everywhere, and offerings of feathers, bones, and sprigs of juniper left before a carved stone marked with that name again: Eagle. They still worship him, it seems.</p>

			<p>I should have turned back. Every instinct told me to. But the place drew me in. Something about it, the weight of history, maybe, or the silence that feels like it's waiting to be broken.</p>

			<p>Inside, the air was thick with dust and the smell of decay. I fought through more Forsworn, mad zealots guarding what they barely understood. The deeper I went, the more the place felt less like a tomb and more like a wound.</p>

			<p>And then I found it.</p>

			<p>A great stone door carved with the emblem of wings unfurled, sealed by some ancient mechanism. Beyond it, a chamber lined with old Nord coffins — not Reachman work. The Empire fought hard to erase this one, but they didn't succeed. On a platform in the center, I found a sword — old steel, scorched and cracked, but humming faintly with magicka. Burns like memory when held, even after centuries.</p>

			<div class="w3-center">

			</div>

			<p>I didn't take it. Not yet. I've seen enough cursed relics to know that some things want to be left alone. Still, I can't deny the pull. The air around it feels... alive.</p>

			<p>I camped outside the tomb tonight, at a small fire under the stars. The sword's image does not leave my mind. A weapon burning with fire and fury, forged by rebellion, buried with its master. It sounds like a fable, but my hands remember the hum of the enchantment. Whatever this Red Eagle was, he was no mere story.</p>

			<p>I wonder why I care. Maybe it's the soldier in me, the part that can't resist the echo of an old campaign. Or maybe I'm just chasing ghosts because they're easier to face than the living.</p>

			<p>Tomorrow, I'll go back. I'll study the enchantment properly, maybe take the blade... for research, of course. A man can tell himself any lie he needs to sleep.</p>

			<p>If the legend is true, Red Eagle rose once for vengeance. Let's hope he's content to stay in his grave.</p>
