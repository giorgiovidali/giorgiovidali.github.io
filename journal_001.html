			<h5><i>Excerpt from the Journal of Marcus Severus</br>4th of Frostfall, 4E 202 - Helgen Hold, Skyrim</i></h5>

			<p>
				The war is over. At least for me. The Legion saw fit to stamp my discharge papers and send me off with a handshake, a half-empty purse, and a letter of commendation that will serve me well to keep a table leg steady. Thirty years under the banner of the Empire, and it ends with the scratching of a quill.				
			</p>

			<p>
				I should feel something, I suppose. Pride, perhaps. Relief. Instead, there is just quiet. Deep, heavy quiet that sits in the bones. Maybe that's what peace feels like after too much war, too much blood.
			</p>

			<p>
				I bought a small patch of land north of Riverwood, by the treeline where the mist rolls down from the hills, overlooking the rapids of the White River. A modest cottage stood there already, half-rotten, but the frame was good. I have been mending it in the mornings and hunting in the afternoons. The woods here are full of life and game: elk, hare, wolves, and entirely too many bandits - stupid enough to think this old man is easy prey. They always learn otherwise.

			<p>
				Gold was not hard to come by, in the Legion. And I saved some, I earned some, and some... well, some I acquired under circumstances that don't bear too much scrutiny. War blurs the line between taking and plundering and stealing. I have long stopped pretending there is a difference. Still, coin is coin, and it bought me peace. And in this cold land peace costs dearly.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These Nords and my own Imperials can keep their damned civil war. I have marched behind more banners than I care to count, and I have buried men from every one of them. Ulfric, Tullius, it makes no difference. I have seen what victory looks like, and it's never clean. Let them fight over who gets to wear the crown, while the rest of us survives the winter.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				My trade now is simple. I hunt, I brew, I craft. The bow keeps food on the table; the knife keeps me alive when it must. The old lessons of the Legion never left me: discipline, patience, precision. Over the years, I picked up a few tricks from the battlemages too. Minor enchantments mostly, enough to give a blade a sharper edge or keep the cold from biting through the armor. I never had the mind for grand spells, but a touch of magic can turn a craftsman into something close to an artist.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Sometimes travelers stop by. They hear that an old Imperial sells good charms and strong potions out here in the woods. I don't ask questions, and I don't give discounts. If they pay fair, they get what they came for. If not, the road is wide and the weather is merciless.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				At night, when the wind dies and the fire burns low, I catch myself listening for the sounds of camp life. The clang of armor, the murmur of men before battle, the orders barked over the dawn. It's strange how silence can feel heavier than war. Maybe that's why I write. To fill the space a little.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				They say the gods watch over soldiers, but I doubt they care too much about the ones who survive. The fallen are heroes; the living are just leftovers. Still, I light a candle each night for the men I have lost and for the man I used to be. Neither are coming back, but it feels wrong to let them fade entirely.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Tomorrow I shall finish that new workbench, and maybe sharpen a few daggers and swords to sell in Whiterun and Falkreath. I might also visit certain alchemists and artisans who pay well for frost salts and wolf pelts. Routine suits me. Keeps the ghosts quiet.
			</p>

			<p>
				If adventure ever finds me, it shall  find a man too old to go chasing glory and too wary to refuse a good bargain. I have learned that every path leads to blood, coin, or both...and I am content with either, so long as I get to choose which.
			</p>

			<p>
				For now, the hills are enough. The Empire can crumble or rise again, and Skyrim can burn or freeze. It makes no difference to me. I have done my fighting. All I want now is to live long enough to forget how good I once was at killing.
			</p>
